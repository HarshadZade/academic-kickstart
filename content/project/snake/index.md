title: Bi-Serpentine Quadrupedal robot (BiSerQ)
summary: Designed snake robots capable of re-configuring into quadraped by attaching together and performing a static gate of a quadraped. Each snake module can individually perform all the gates that any normal snake performs.

Snake robots provide an efficient mobility solution  for traversing through pipes, crevasses and rough terrain but are limited when traversing over structured environments. Also, autonomous path planning is still a challenging area for snakes.
In comparison, legged robots do not suffer from these limitations but may not be as robust as snake robots when moving in rough terrain.
In general, snakes and legged robots have different efficiencies, speed, payload capacity, etc., depending on the type of environment that the robot is trying to traverse. 
Furthermore, similar trade-offs exists for different type of legged robots such as biped and quadrupeds. 
A large body of prior work exists on re-configurable robots to get the best of all these worlds.
However, most of these solutions consist of a large number of complicated mechanisms to detach and re-attach at different places making the system fragile and increase its size, weight and powe (SWaP).
We propose a **Bi-Serpentine Quadrupedal robot (BiSerQ)** that easily transforms from snake robots to a quadruped with minimal change in modules.
Experimental results on hardware demonstrate the mobility in both snake and quadruped modes and transition between them.
